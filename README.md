# Face-Mask-Detection
# 😷 Face Mask Detection using CNN (Keras + TensorFlow)

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning model that detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. It uses TensorFlow's Keras API and is trained on a labeled dataset of images containing people with and without face masks.

## 📌 Features

- Binary classification: **Mask** vs **No Mask**
- Built using **TensorFlow 2.x** and **Keras Sequential API**
- Visualizes training performance (accuracy/loss plots)
- Predicts on custom uploaded images
- Easy to run in **Google Colab**

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains two folders:
face-mask-dataset/
├── with_mask/
└── without_mask/

🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository or open the notebook in Google Colab.

Upload the dataset (face-mask-dataset.zip) and extract it.

Run the notebook step-by-step:

Load and visualize the data

Build the CNN model

Train and evaluate it
